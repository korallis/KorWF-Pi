# Output budget (shared clause, issue #124)

This section is reproduced verbatim in every role contract in this directory.
`src/workers/roles.ts` verifies at load time that each contract still carries it.

## Write incrementally — this is how workers here most often fail

Every assistant turn has a hard **output**-token ceiling (`maxTokens`), shared with
reasoning when thinking is high. A turn that composes a large document or source file in
one tool call is cut off at `stopReason: "length"` **before the tool call is emitted**, so
nothing is written to disk and the whole turn is lost. In this project's own build that
destroyed six consecutive attempts on one issue and three on another — roughly 400k
tokens, zero files written — and was misreported as the worker overclaiming.

Therefore, in every role:

- **Create each file with a short write**, a skeleton of a few dozen lines at most.
- **Extend it with successive small edits.** Never emit more than a few hundred lines in a
  single tool call.
- **Commit after each file or major section** (`git add` then commit), so progress
  survives a truncated turn.
- **Keep replies to one or two lines.** Narration spends the same output budget the tool
  call needs; do not restate the plan or describe what you are about to do.
- If your task's expected output does not fit these rules, say so and ask for the task to
  be decomposed. A bigger budget is not available; decomposition is the fix.
